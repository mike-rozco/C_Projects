  // starts at 0, increments by 1, and exits once i < argc is not true. What is

  // prints the current integer value of i, while the second prints the value of
  // the element at that array's index. All arrays are indexed starting with
  // zero and the crucial thing that is a source of frustration starting out is
  // remembering that indexes are always 1 less than the length of any array.
  // You can also think of it as indexes shift to the left by one.
